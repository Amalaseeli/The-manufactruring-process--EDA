# Exploratory Data Analysis - The Manufacturing Process

This project aims to analyze and preprocess data from a manufacturing process to detect anomalies and improve product quality. The data undergoes transformations to handle skewness, impute missing values, and visualize various features for better understanding. We perform data extraction from cloud storage and a relational database service (RDS), followed by cleaning, transformation, and visualization.

# Machine failure dataset data dictionary

- **UID**: Unique identifier of the machining session
- **product_ID**: Product specific serial number
- **Type**: Quality of the product being created L, M, or H, for low, medium and high quality products
- **air temperature [K]**: Average air temperature in the room during the process in Kelvin
- **process temperature [K]**:  Average air temperature the machine was operating at during production in Kelvin
- **Rotational speed [rpm]**: Average revolutions per minute the tool was operating at
- **Torque [Nm]**: Torque generated by the tool in Newton-meters
- **Tool wear [min]**: The current minutes of wear on the tool in minutes. H, M and L product manufacturing cause 5/3/2 minutes of tool wear.
- **machine failure**: Label that indicates, whether the machine failed this particular run
- **TWF (tool wear failure)**: Failure in the process due to the tool wearing out
- **head dissipation failure (HDF)**: Lack of heat dissipation caused the process failure
- **power failure (PWF)**: Failure in the process due to lack of power from the tool to complete the process
- **overstrain failure (OSF)**: Failure due to the tool overstraining during the process
- **random failures (RNF)**: Failures in the process which couldn't be categorised

## Extracting Data from the RDS Database
- To extract data from a Relational Database Service (RDS) such as Amazon RDS, follow these steps:

1. Database Connection Setup: Ensure you have the database credentials (host, port, username, password, database name).

2. Install Required Libraries:
  - Use psycopg2 for PostgreSQL, pymysql for MySQL, or any other appropriate library based on your RDS database type.

## Installation
Cloning Repository to your local machine

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Amalaseeli/The-manufactruring-process--EDA.git
  
```

## Data Preprocessing
- The extracted data undergoes several preprocessing steps:

1. Handling Missing Values: Columns with missing data are either filled using statistical imputation methods or dropped if the missing rate is too high.
2. Detecting Skewness: Identify and correct skewed distributions using transformations like log, Box-Cox, or Yeo-Johnson.
3. Normalization and Scaling: Normalize or scale the features to standardize their range for better model performance.

## Visualization:
- The project includes visualizations to understand the data distributions and transformations:

- Histograms for original and transformed distributions.
-  Q-Q plots for assessing normality.
-  Box plots to visualize outliers.
    
## Results
- Processed data and generated visualizations are saved in the results/ directory.
